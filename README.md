# MNE_through

MNE-Python is an open-source Python package for working with EEG and MEG data. It was originally developed as a Python port (translation from one programming language to another) of a software package called MNE. [1]

I'm very intested in brain signal research and I came across this wonderful mne package. It provides all researchers the tool to leverage data science methodologies to explore the brain signals, especially EEG, MEG, etc. It changes the ecosystem of neuroscience research. It largely improves the accuracy and precise of neuro disease diangosis and reduces human errors. 

What is EEG? Electroencephalography (EEG) is a method to record an electrogram of the spontaneous electrical activity of the brain. The biosignals detected by EEG have been shown to represent the postsynaptic potentials of pyramidal neurons in the neocortex and allocortex. The measurements given by an EEG are used to confirm or rule out various conditions, including: seizure disorders (such as epilepsy), head injury, encephalitis (inflammation of the brain), brain tumor, encephalopathy (disease that causes brain dysfunction), sleep disorders, stroke and dementia. 

A study on EEG accuracy of epileptiform discharges (ED) diangosis. Amongst adult studies, the sensitivity and specificity (95% confidence interval) of routine EEG were 17.3% (7.9, 33.8) and 94.7% (73.7, 99.1), respectively. Amongst child studies, the pooled sensitivity and specificity were 57.8% (49.7, 65.6) and 69.6% (57.5, 79.5), respectively. Based upon our positive likelihood ratios, and assuming a pre-test probability of 50%, an adult with ED on routine EEG after a first unprovoked seizure has a 77% probability of having a second seizure, whilst a child with similar findings has a 66% probability.[2] 

How MNE helps EEG diagnosis? MNE provides comprehensive analysis tools and workflows including preprocessing, source estimation, timeâ€“frequency analysis, statistical analysis, and several methods to estimate functional connectivity between distributed brain regions. [3]

  a. MNE software provides a complete pipeline for MEG and EEG data analysis
  b. MNE covers preprocessing, forward modeling, inverse methods, and visualization
  c. MNE supports advanced analysis: time-frequency, statistics, and connectivity
  d. MNE-Python enables fast and memory-efficent processing of large data sets
  e. The MNE-Python is open-source software supporting a collaborative development effort
  
 This project explored most of MNE (version 1.2.2) function for analyzing EEG, MEG, EOG, etc signals. and provided a complete overview of brain wave analysis.
